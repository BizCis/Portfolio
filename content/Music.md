A few years ago, I discovered that music has a special power to express emotions and thoughts in a unique way. This passion led me to venture beyond just listening to music; I decided to create it. Together with a friend from university, we formed a band called "Salón Morado." We embarked on the exciting journey of composing our own songs, blending genres and experimenting with different sounds. Each song is a piece of us, infused with our joys, sorrows, and hopes.

This gallery is a collection of moments from our band "Salón Morado." It captures our rehearsal sessions, concerts, and the creative process behind each song. It's a testament to our evolution as artists and the magic that happens when a passion for music unites us.
